# Oracle HTP Plugin
Oracle HTP Macro takes its name from Oracle HTP package, which is commonly used to generate HTML pages and other web content in Oracle stored procedure. This content is then delivered to a client via Oracle HTTP Server that is connected to Oracle database by means of data access descriptor (DAD). Oracle HTP Macro for Confluence allows publishing HTML, generated by Oracle, in your Confluence page. No Oracle HTTP Server is required. Drop Oracle HTP Macro on page, select a DAD, specify render method, call parameters (if any), and a stored procedure to call. Save the page and you will get whatever HTML (JSON, binary data, etc...) is generated by your Oracle database.
